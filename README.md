# Pumpkin-Party


## Issues and ideas


### Lobby
- Archillager sound global

### Wardens Lair
- Put spectators onto stage in warden game
- Play sounds for players in spectator
- Most boring part of the map if you're dead
- Somehow explain better that you need to rightclick the items in your inventory.
- add a way to skip the cutscene (e.g. croutch)
- stop trapdoor interaction through interaction entity?


### Pumpkin Carving 
- Duplicate filler with offhand?


### Misc
Minigame idea:
Ghasts in Maze with Fishing hooks

Shaders to turn the particle X into a proper X or some other texture?

Finally make players
